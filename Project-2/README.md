Here is the description Vite React JS Project 2 :

<p>Basic Contact Form with React Hooks and Components</p>

This project is a basic example of using React, Vite, and React Hooks to create a simple contact form. While the page itself is not dynamic, it demonstrates the use of components, props, and the useState Hook to create interactive elements.

The project includes the following features:
-A navbar section
-A contact form with fields for name, email, and message
-A submit button that displays the entered information below the form upon submission
-Three additional buttons, each with a unique alert message
This project is a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to use React and Vite to create interactive web applications with components, props, and state management.
